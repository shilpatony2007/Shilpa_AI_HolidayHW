<h1><p align="center">Advantages & Disadvantages<br></p></h1>
 <br><h2> Advantages</h2><br>
 1) Reduction in Human Error:AI system would have low error rate compared to human ,if coded properly.
Example: In Weather Forecasting using AI they have reduced the majority of human error.<br>

2) Takes risks instead of Humans: We can overcome many risky limitations of humans by developing an AI Robot which in turn can do the risky things for us. 
Example: going to mars, defuse a bomb , explore the deepest parts of oceans, mining for coal and oil

3) Available 24x7:They don’t need to sleep,rest,take breaks or get entertained . So we can make machines work 24x7 without any breaks and they don’t even get bored or tired, unlike humans.
Example: Educational Institutes and Helpline centers are getting many queries and issues which can be handled effectively using AI.<br>
4) Helping in Repetitive Jobs: Using artificial intelligence we can productively automate these mundane tasks and can even remove “boring” tasks for humans and free them up to be increasingly creative.
Example: Sending a thanking mail, verifying certain documents for errors <br>
 
5) Can avoid Fraud : The AI system can detect fraud in card based systems and possibly other systems in the future <br>
 
6) Faster Decisions: While taking a decision human will analyze many factors both emotionally and practically but AI-powered machine works on what it is 
programmed and delivers the results in a faster way. Example: We all have played Chess games in Windows. It is nearly impossible to beat CPU in the hard
 mode because of the AI behind that game. <br>
 
 <br><h2>Disadvantages </h2><br> 
1)High Costs of Creation:  As AI is updating every day the hardware and software need to get updated with time to meet the latest requirements.
 It’ s creation requires huge costs as they are very complex machines.<br>

2)Making Humans Lazy: AI is making humans lazy with its applications automating the majority of the work. Humans tend to get addicted to these inventions
 which can cause a problem to future generations.<br>

3)Unemployment: As AI is replacing the majority of the repetitive tasks and other works with robots,human interference is becoming less which will cause a
 major problem in the employment standardsNo Emotions: There is no doubt that machines are much better when it comes to working efficiently but they cannot
 replace the human connection that makes the team.<br>

4)Lacking Out of Box Thinking: Machines can perform only those tasks which they are designed or programmed to do, anything out of that they tend to crash or
 give irrelevant outputs which could be a major backdrop.<br>
